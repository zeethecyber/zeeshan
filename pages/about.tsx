              IÂ am aÂ software engineer working out of Lagos, Nigeria, and IÂ am
              constantly looking for ground-breaking solutions to issues that
              arise in daily life. In my work, IÂ spend most of my time coming up
              with innovative solutions to development problems.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I've been aÂ part of this industry for over two years and within
              those years, I've honed my analytic and collaboration skills which
              makes working with aÂ team easier. I've also had the opportunity to
              serve as lead software engineer for different projects.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Even though IÂ stumbled upon code by accident, it's something I've
              come to really like. But like they say, good things come to us
              without plan, no? IÂ especially enjoy watching code bring to life
              an entirely new beautiful thing, it's magical.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              For me, each project IÂ have the privilege to work on is aÂ new
              opportunity to learn new things, meet people with ideas that
              differ from mine and discover things about myself IÂ never knew
              were beneath the layers of all of me.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              IÂ enjoy watching anime and IÂ am very into the Marvel franchise.
              IÂ listen to lots of music and James Blake and Jon Bellion are
              probably my two favourite artists (for now). Let's not forget the
              guys at Snarky Puppy, they're amazing. IÂ spend most of my free
              time with my family and my cat.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">

              patienceðŸ˜… I'm available for full-time roles and freelance
              projects worldwide. As long as you don't mind watching me work
