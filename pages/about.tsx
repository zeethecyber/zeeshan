              I am a software engineer working out of Lagos, Nigeria, and I am
              constantly looking for ground-breaking solutions to issues that
              arise in daily life. In my work, I spend most of my time coming up
              with innovative solutions to development problems.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I've been a part of this industry for over two years and within
              those years, I've honed my analytic and collaboration skills which
              makes working with a team easier. I've also had the opportunity to
              serve as lead software engineer for different projects.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Even though I stumbled upon code by accident, it's something I've
              come to really like. But like they say, good things come to us
              without plan, no? I especially enjoy watching code bring to life
              an entirely new beautiful thing, it's magical.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              For me, each project I have the privilege to work on is a new
              opportunity to learn new things, meet people with ideas that
              differ from mine and discover things about myself I never knew
              were beneath the layers of all of me.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I enjoy watching anime and I am very into the Marvel franchise.
              I listen to lots of music and James Blake and Jon Bellion are
              probably my two favourite artists (for now). Let's not forget the
              guys at Snarky Puppy, they're amazing. I spend most of my free
              time with my family and my cat.
            </p>

              I'm surprised you actually read all of that, well thanks for your
              patience😅 I'm available for full-time roles and freelance
              projects worldwide. As long as you don't mind watching me work
              from screens away. Want to Start a Project? Let’s
