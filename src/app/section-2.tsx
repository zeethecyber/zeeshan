      <p className="font-semibold">Hello People! üëãüèª</p>
      <p>
        My journey in the tech world began back in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">2021</span> while I was still pursuing my
        degree. I vividly remember the excitement of landing my first gig on{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Fiverr</span>, even if it was just for{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">$10</span>. Since then, I&apos;ve had the
        pleasure of collaborating with numerous clients and teams, helping build
        everything from small-scale projects to full-fledged{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">web and mobile applications</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I&apos;m a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time freelancer</span>, and I also
        take on the role of <span className="font-medium">Project Manager</span>{" "}
        at Deversiti IT Solutions. My current focus is on expanding my{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">skills in Web 3</span> technologies, and
        I‚Äôm always eager to learn and tackle new challenges.{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Coding and problem-solving</span>{" "}
        aren&apos;t just my job‚Äîthey‚Äôre my passion. That dedication and love for
        what I do are what I bring to every project, and it&apos;s my{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">clients&apos; appreciation ‚ù§Ô∏è</span> that
        drives me to keep pushing forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I‚Äôm not in front of a screen, you‚Äôll find me out for a walk,
        catching up with friends and family, or just enjoying some downtime.
